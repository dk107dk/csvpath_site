**Our Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms**

We and our service providers use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to track information about your use of our Site or Software. We may combine this information with other personal information we collect from you (and our service providers may do so on our behalf). We use cookies for functional purposes only (i.e. to support the proper working of our Site) and do not use cookies for advertising or profiling purposes.

Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your device’s hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our Site, while others are used to allow us to track your activities at our Site. There are two types of cookies: session and persistent cookies.

* Session Cookies: Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your device when you close your browser or turn off your device. We use session cookies to allow our systems to uniquely identify you during a session or while you are logged into the Site. This allows us to process your online transactions and requests and verify your identity, after you have logged in, as you move through our Site.
* Persistent Cookies: Persistent cookies remain on your device after you have closed your browser or turned off your device. We use persistent cookies to track aggregate and statistical information about user activity.

_**Disabling Cookies:**_ Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can change your browser options to block them. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Visitors to our Site who disable cookies will be able to browse certain areas of the Site, but some features may not function properly.

**Third Party:** We use automated devices and applications to evaluate usage of our Site. We use these tools to help us improve our Site’s user experience.

**Do-Not-Track**. Currently, the Site does not recognize browser “do-not-track” requests, except to the degree our service parters' infrastructure provides that capability. You may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed in this section (e.g., by disabling cookies).

**User Generated Content**

We invite you to post content on our Site where such opportunities exist, if any. If you post content to our Site the information that you post will be available to all visitors to our Site. If you post your own content on our Site or Services, your posting may become public.

**Third-Party Links**

Our Site may contain links to third-party websites. Any access to, and use of, such linked websites is not governed by this Policy, but instead is governed by the privacy policies of those third-party websites. We are not responsible for the information practices of such third-party websites.

**Security of My Personal Information**

We have implemented reasonable precautions to protect the information we collect from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Please be aware that despite our best efforts, no data security measures can guarantee security.

You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your phone and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your log-in and password private. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords or for any activity on your account.

**Access to My Personal Information**

You may modify personal information that you have submitted. Please note that copies of any information you update may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Site for a period of time.

**What Choices Do I Have Regarding Use of My Personal Information?**

If you provide us with your email we may send periodic promotional emails to you regarding the Software. You may opt-out of promotional emails by following the opt-out instructions contained in the email.
