# DATA PREBOARDING

CsvPath is the leading tool for automated data preboarding. It is a purpose-built open source Python framework integrated with a wide variety of popular DataOps tools that acts as a trusted publisher between MFT and the data laken and applications.&#x20;

## What is Data Preboarding?

Data preboarding is the process of receiving external data. Preboarding assigns a durable identity, validates that the data meets expectations, canonicalizes it for downstream productivity, and stages it for loading into the data lake and/or applications. Your data lake deserves a data publisher it can trust! Once data is pre-boarded it is known-good and no longer considered external.

Data Preboarding may be a new term, but it is not a new concept. All data goes through this pre-boarding process on its way into the organization. The question is, how well does the process work? The experience of most companies is that the process is less reliable, holds more risk, and is much more expensive than is comfortable. &#x20;

## How does the CsvPath Framework help? &#x20;

CsvPath is a drop-in replacement for rickety data landing zones. It is  laser-focused on automated data pre-boarding.  CsvPath brings a lot of capabilities to the table:&#x20;

* An opinionated framework for collecting, identifying, validating and publishing data that you can spin up literally in seconds
* Powerful validation that has never before been available for delimited data
* Explainability-focused metadata production that gives you the power to know exactly what happened as your data evolved
* Out-of-the-box integrations for lineage tracking, observability, MFT (managed file transfer), and more

With the CsvPath Framework you are signing up for a well-known pattern that settles the architecture and design questions up-front, leaving your team focused on data quality and accountability. And with CsvPath's the automation-forward approach, you can scale-down manual data quality efforts and scale up data throughput.

## How to get started

If you are a developer, take a look at the [Quickstart ](getting-started/quickstart.md)and the [Your First Validation](getting-started/your-first-validation-the-lazy-way.md) exercises. They will get you up and running and introduce the CLI, the fastest way to get started. Reading about [schemas vs. rules-based validation](topics/validation/schemas-or-rules.md) would be useful. Take a look the [How-tos](topics/how-tos/) and [DataOps integrations](getting-started/integrations/) sections. There is a [cheatsheet](topics/a-csvpath-cheatsheet.md) and [validation language basics](topics/language.md). And there is more information on the[ GitHub site](https://github.com/csvpath/csvpath).

For a higher-level view on the topics of edge governance and data preboarding, try the [atesta analytics  whitepapers](https://www.atestaanalytics.com/downloads). They are CsvPath focused, but speak to the overarching operational and organizational needs.

Data pre-boarding is everywhere. And yet it is dramatically undertooled. We're on a mission to change that. Welcome aboard!
