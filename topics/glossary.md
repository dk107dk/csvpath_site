# Glossary

Buzzwords are fun. When they actually mean something they are a way to communicate important concepts in just a few words. Or they can just be buzzy. Here are some brief definitions to take the buzz out and put the meaning in.

## Architectural Pattern



## Collect, Store, Validate Publish



## Data Preboarding



## Data Upgrading

Data upgrading is similar, but not identical, to canonicalization. It is the process of smoothing the rough edges in order to make data comparable and accessible.&#x20;

Upgrading includes modest changes like:&#x20;

* Conforming capitalization
* Using a single type of quotation marks and delimiters
* Removing excess space
* Synchronizing date formats
* Etc, etc.

This is not big transformation stuff. And it is not data mastering. Rather it targets basic error prevention and productivity.

## Data Validation

Validation is the act of making certain that an item of data meets expectations. That much is clear. But there are four important concepts that come under the heading of validation. [We talked about them here](validation/well-formed-valid-canonical-and-correct.md). In super brief terms:&#x20;

* Well-formedness
* Valid
* Canonical
* Correct

## Edge Governance



## Trusted Publisher
