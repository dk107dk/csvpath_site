# Python

This area has a few CsvPath Framework Python starters and some discussion of CsvPath Language vs. Python. There is of course lots more Python snippets on other pages. More are coming over time. &#x20;

[The GitHub repo](https://github.com/csvpath/csvpath) has all kinds of docs, including some Python examples. And the Framework's [public Python interface is documented here](https://csvpath.github.io/csvpath/csvpath.html).
