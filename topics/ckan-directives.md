# CKAN directives

[CKAN](https://ckan.org/showcase) is a portal purpose-built for data discovery and distribution. It is backed by the [Open Knowledge Foundation](https://okfn.org/en/) and used by large-scale data publishers, from the US federal government's [data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/) to LEGO.

CKAN is integrated with CsvPath through the event listener mechanism. When named-paths groups run, CKAN is notified and receives content. The integration is standard and requires only two minor changes to `config.ini` to activate.

## Setup the link to CKAN&#x20;

Open `config/config.ini` (or wherever your config file is). We have two changes to make:&#x20;

* Enable the listener
* Add the server details

Look for the `[listeners]` section in `config.ini`. Make sure the `ckan.results` key has the name of the CKAN listener class. Second, add ckan to the list in the `groups` key. If there are other groups enabled put `ckan` at the end after a comma. Your file should look like this:&#x20;

Next, make sure you have a `[ckan]` section. It should have two keys:&#x20;

* server
* api\_token

&#x20;The server key takes a URL for your CKAN instance. If you're just trying out CKAN you may be running CsvPath on the CKAN server or, more likely, on the same machine as you are running the CKAN docker containers. In this case, put in `http://localhost:80`.

The `api_token` key takes your CKAN token. Log into CKAN and open your profile (see the link at the top right of every page). You should see three tabs. Click on the tab for API tokens and create one. Paste the value into your `config.ini` on the `api_token` key. Your `config.ini` should look like this:&#x20;

## The directives

You're all integrated! Time to see what you can do with CKAN.

Publishing datasets to CKAN requires that you add directives to your csvpaths. The directives go in an external comment. An external comment is one that is outside the csvpath, above or below it. You can add as many CKAN directives, modes settings, user-defined metadata, etc. as you like in your comments.

A set of directives might look like:&#x20;

Let's go through what these directives mean.&#x20;

If the indicated group doesn't exist it will be created.</p><p></p><p><code>use-archive</code> means that the name in config.ini under the archive key is used to identify the group.  </p><p></p><p><code>used-named-results</code> makes the group name the same as the named-paths group's name.

The identity of a csvpath is the <code>name</code> or <code>id</code> field in its metadata (so set in an external comment) or its zero-based index in the run. </p><p></p><p><code>use-named-results</code> means the dataset should have the same name as the named-paths group. </p><p></p><p><code>var-value</code> points to a variable, the word after the colon.

In general, user-friendly titles may include upper and lower case, spaces, and common punctuation. Most names, URL slugs, IDs, tags, etc. can only have alphanums, `.`, `_`, and `-` and will be lowercased.&#x20;
