# Store source data and/or named-paths and/or the archive in Google Cloud Storage

This page is really just here to point to [the S3 instructions](../store-source-data-and-or-named-paths-and-or-the-archive-in-aws-s3.md) because everything is basically the same.&#x20;

You need a `GCS_CREDENTIALS_PATH` environment variable. It points to the location of your service account JSON credentials file. Other than that, there's no additional setup — just use of gs`://` instead of `sftp://` or `s3://` in `config/config.ini` or when you add content with `FileManager` or `PathsManager`.&#x20;

Super easy!
