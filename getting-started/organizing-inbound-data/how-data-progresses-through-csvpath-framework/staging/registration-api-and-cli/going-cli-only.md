# Going CLI-only

The CsvPath Framework's CLI is a great development and testing tool. It works without code in a local environment, enabling you to get projects started fast and iterate on your csvpath statements rapidly.

The CLI is not comprehensive. It supports references, but not the complete range of flexibility. It does not provide any support for templates; you would have to add those by editing JSON or using the API.&#x20;
