# Schemas

## Try these examples yourself. They are built into FlightPath Data. You can download FlightPath Data free from [Microsoft](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9P9PBPKZ4JDF) or [Apple](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/flightpath-data/id6745823097) or [Github](https://github.com/dk107dk/flightpath)[ub](https://github.com/dk107dk/flightpath)

## Making schemas for CSV and Excel

CsvPath Framework supports data validation using schemas and rules. Both approaches have their own strengths.

This example shows how to create a simple schema that functions much like a SQL DDL schema.

The DDL example is in the file person.sql.txt. It has a simplistic 3-table model of a person with address and contact information.

The examples in the file schemas.csvpath show four variations on an analogous CsvPath schema that can be used with a CSV or Excel file.

Run any of the csvpaths by putting your cursor in the csvpath you want to run and typing **control-r** or right-clicking and selecting **Run**.
