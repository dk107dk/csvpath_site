# Store source data and/or named-paths and/or the archive in Azure

This page is really just here to point to [the S3 instructions](store-source-data-and-or-named-paths-and-or-the-archive-in-aws-s3.md) because everything is basically the same.&#x20;

You need a `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING` environment variable holding your storage account connection string. Other than that, there's no additional setup — just use of `azure://` instead of `sftp://` or `s3://` in `config/config.ini` or when you add content with `FileManager` or `PathsManager`.&#x20;

So easy!
