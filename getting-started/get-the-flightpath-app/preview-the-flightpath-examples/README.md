[FlightPath Data](../../get-the-flightpath-app.md) comes with a set of CsvPath examples that can help you get started quickly. Each time you create a new project it comes with an examples directory, so you always have ideas at hand.

These pages are some of the READMEs and CsvPath Language files from the FlightPath examples. To see the full examples, with sample data, in a working environment, just [install FlightPath](https://www.flightpathdata.com/).&#x20;
