## Making schemas for CSV and Excel

CsvPath Framework supports data validation using schemas and rules. Both approaches have their own strengths.

This example shows how to create a simple schema that functions much like a SQL DDL schema.

The DDL example is in the file person.sql.txt. It has a simplistic 3-table model of a person with address and contact information.

The examples in the file schemas.csvpath show four variations on an analogous CsvPath schema that can be used with a CSV or Excel file.

Run any of the csvpaths by putting your cursor in the csvpath you want to run and typing **control-r** or right-clicking and selecting **Run**.
