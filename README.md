## The Framework For Automated Data Preboarding

### Your inbound flat-files handled efficiently with automated quality.

The open source [CsvPath Framework](https://github.com/csvpath/csvpath) **makes robust DataOps at the parameter easy**. CsvPath Framework brings CSV, Excel, and other delimited and tabular data files to your data lake and applications as the **Trusted Publisher**. &#x20;

CSV and Excel validation is core to the Framework. **CsvPath Validation Language** is simple, easy to integrate, and flexible enough to handle the unexpected. Inspired by [Schematron](https://schematron.com/), [XPath](https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-31/), and [the Collect, Store, Validate, Publish design pattern](topics/the-collect-store-validate-pattern.md), CsvPath Validation Language brings powerful data validation to less structured data. Coming from the world of DDL, XSD, or JSON Schema? [Start here](topics/validation/schemas-or-rules.md).

The **CsvPath Framework** implements a complete [**Collect, Store, Validate Publish Pattern** ](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/66df9d47982d0d40e1574327/t/6771fe6f63bbf5361725ad05/1735523953587/The+Collect+Store+Validate+Pattern+-+Atesta+Analytics.pdf)that makes data preboarding faster, cost-efficient, and more effective. Out-of-the-box, CsvPath Framework fills the blindspot between MFT (managed file transfer) and the data lake with a simple path to provably correct data.

This data onboarding blindspot is a big deal. Think about it. If even 1 in 30 companies depends heavily on CSV or Excel data, the _lack of **delimited file pre-boarding is a trillion-dollar problem**_. In our experience, 1 in 30 would be a low estimate.&#x20;

Now, introducing [**FlightPath**, a powerful new frontend to CsvPath Framework](https://www.flightpathdata.com/). Go beyond the built-in CLI. Leverage the architecture with a purpose-built preboarding development and operations console. And FlightPath gives you all the help and examples you need to get started fast. Available as a _free_ download from the [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9p9pbpkz4jdf?hl=en-US\&gl=US) and the [Apple MacOS Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/flightpath-data/id6745823097).

**CsvPath Framework** can help you build confidence that your organization's data governance doesn't turn a blind eye to your most unruly data. Take a look through these pages and cruise over to the validation language [docs](https://github.com/csvpath/csvpath) on the [CsvPath Github](https://github.com/csvpath/csvpath) to see if open source CSV and Excel **data pre-boarding should be part of your DataOps toolkit**.
