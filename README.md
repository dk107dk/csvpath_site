#### CsvPath is an open source framework that registers, validates, upgrades, and stages CSV and Excel files from data partners before they break your pipelines.

[CsvPath Framework](https://github.com/csvpath/csvpath) is a data quality shift-left that enables you to control data entering the enterprise with **less manual effort, fewer ingestion failures, and more agile development** using a straightforward data preboarding pattern.  &#x20;

### Introducing FlightPath Data, the frontend to CsvPath Framework

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/flightpath-logo-1-sm.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

[**FlightPath Data** is a powerful new frontend to CsvPath Framework](https://www.flightpathdata.com/). Go beyond CsvPath Framework's built-in CLI. Get up and running faster with a purpose-built preboarding development and operations console. FlightPath Data gives you all the help and examples you need move quickly.&#x20;

FlightPath Data is bundled with **FlightPath Server**, the automation REST API connecting your existing infrastructure to data preboarding.&#x20;

Available as a _free_ download from the [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9p9pbpkz4jdf?hl=en-US\&gl=US) and the [Apple MacOS Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/flightpath-data/id6745823097).

### The Architecture For Efficient Data File Feed Ingestion

**CsvPath Framework** implements the [**Collect, Store, Validate Publish architectural pattern.** ](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/66df9d47982d0d40e1574327/t/6771fe6f63bbf5361725ad05/1735523953587/The+Collect+Store+Validate+Pattern+-+Atesta+Analytics.pdf)This data preboarding style of ingestion goes faster, is more cost-efficient, and is more effective. Why roll your own preboarding solution when there is a purpose-built option?

Out-of-the-box, CsvPath Framework is built to fill the blindspot between MFT (managed file transfer) and the data lake with a simple path to provably correct data.

This data onboarding blindspot is a big deal. Think about it. If even 1 in 30 companies depends heavily on CSV or Excel data, the _lack of **delimited file pre-boarding is a trillion-dollar problem**_. In our experience, 1 in 30 would be a low estimate.&#x20;

### Powerful CSV and Excel Validation

CSV and Excel validation is core to the Framework. **CsvPath Validation Language** is simple, easy to integrate, and flexible enough to handle the unexpected. Inspired by Schematron, XPath, and SQL, CsvPath Validation Language brings powerful data validation to less structured data. [Start here](topics/validation/schemas-or-rules.md).

Together CsvPath Framework and FlightPath Data can help you build leadership's confidence that your data governance doesn't turn a blind eye to your most unruly data.&#x20;
