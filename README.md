# CsvPath

## **A path to data validation for the files that need it most!**

[CsvPath](https://github.com/csvpath/csvpath) is a declarative validation language to verify that CSV, Excel, and other delimited and tabular data meet expectations.&#x20;

The CsvPath language, and its Python library, is simple, easy to integrate, and flexible enough to handle the unexpected quirks of CSV and Excel data. Inspired by [Schematron](https://schematron.com/), [XPath](https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-31/), and [the Collect, Store, Validate design pattern](topics/the-collect-store-validate-pattern.md), CsvPath brings rules-based data validation to less structured data.

<table data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th data-hidden data-card-cover data-type="files"></th><th data-hidden></th><th data-hidden data-card-target data-type="content-ref"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Getting Started</strong></td><td>5-minutes to get the idea</td><td><a href=".gitbook/assets/how_to_start3.png">how_to_start3.png</a></td><td></td><td><a href="getting-started/quickstart.md">quickstart.md</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Your First Validation</strong></td><td>Learn by implementing a realistic validation</td><td><a href=".gitbook/assets/csv_file_image4.png">csv_file_image4.png</a></td><td></td><td><a href="broken-reference">Broken link</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>A Path To Production</strong></td><td>Automate CSV data quality</td><td><a href=".gitbook/assets/code-green.png">code-green.png</a></td><td></td><td><a href="getting-started/your-first-validation.md">your-first-validation.md</a></td></tr></tbody></table>

Think about it. If even 1 in 30 companies depends heavily on CSV or Excel data, the _lack of good delimited file validation is a trillion-dollar problem_. In our experience, 1 in 30 would be a low estimate.&#x20;

CsvPath isn't the silver bullet to reams of messy delimited data, but it can help build confidence that your data governance doesn't turn a blind eye to your most unruly data.&#x20;

Take a look through these pages and cruise over to the [detailed docs](https://github.com/csvpath/csvpath) on the [CsvPath Github](https://github.com/csvpath/csvpath) to see if open source CSV and Excel data validation should be part of your DataOps toolkit.
